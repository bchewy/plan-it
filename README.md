### What is Plan-it?
Plan-it is a sustainable travel routing web-app built on Google Maps to help users consciously keep track of their carbon emissions savings when commuting.

### What's the purpose?
To encourage green choices, we will implement gamification features like rewards and social sharing for selecting low-carbon routes. The app will also provide tools for tracking carbon footprint over time, optimized route planning based on sustainability, and a community forum for knowledge sharing around sustainable transportation.
